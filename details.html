                                As the plumb is volunteer-run and we do not currently receive funding, we cannot provide artist fees. We are readily available to assist artists in the sourcing of external project funding, installation and potential material sourcing and needs. We acknowledge the precarity of the artist run-model and the nature of artist opportunities in the city and commit to actively working towards sustainable compensation for collaborators in time.
